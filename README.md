# Udacity-FEND-Jasmine-Testing
Feed Reader testing using Jasmine for a web app. For this project, we were provided with index.html, style.css, app.js and all files that jasmine testing depends on. The assignement was to add testing to the app as the previous developer has moved on to another project. Most all coding that I was responsible for can be found in [/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js](https://github.com/GBClemson/Udacity-FEND-Jasmine-Testing/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js)

#### To run the app ####
* You must clone or download all of the files from this repository.
* You can inspect the tests in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`
* Once you have all of the files you can launch `index.html` to see the live feedreader
