# Udacity-FEND-Jasmine-Testing
Feed Reader testing using Jasmine for a web app. For this project, we were provided with index.html, style.css, app.js and all files that jasmine testing depends on. The assignement was to add testing to the app as the previous developer has moved on to another project. Most all coding that I was responsible for can be found in [/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js] (https://github.com/GBClemson/Udacity-FEND-Jasmine-Testing/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js)
